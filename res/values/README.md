These are all the strings in KDE Connect which are localized if the app is run in a language other than English. You can find their translations in the directory a level above this one in the directory belonging to the language.

# Dear potential translators:

Thank you for your interest in KDE Connect! We do not actually handle our own translations.
All translations for all KDE apps are handled by the [localization team](https://l10n.kde.org).
We really appreciate your translations, but make sure to submit them by working with the proper team!
